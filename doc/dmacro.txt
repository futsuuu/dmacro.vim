INTRODUCTION                                                     *dmacro-intro*

Text editors have evolved to support input in different ways.

- Word completion based on dictionary data (e.g. CTRL-X completion in Vim)
- Code fragment completion based on dictionary data (e.g. Snippet Completion)
- Contextual, rule-based word completion (e.g. Language Server Protocol)
- Completion of larger code fragments using generative AI (GitHub Copilot)

All of these were hailed as revolutionary when they first appeared.
What's the next big assistive feature? I say **operation completion**.
Currently, completion is for new code. But most coding isn't new creation.
It's overwriting, like editing or updating. Shouldn't this be supported?

RELATED WORKS                                                   *dmacro-related*

- dmacro.el (Emacs) https://github.com/emacs-jp/dmacro
- Dynacmic Macro for Visual Studio Code https://github.com/tshino/vscode-dynamic-macro

This plugin dynamically defines a macro.
You do not need to make any markers for the macro.
To define a macro, this plugin detects the reputation as follows:

- If you enter the same key sequence twice (e.g. `abcabc`),
  this plugin will define a macro with the key sequence (e.g. `abc`).

- If you type the subsequence (e.g. `a`) of the previous key sequence (e.g. `abc`),
  this plugin will define a macro with the rest of the previous
  sequence (e.g. `bc`). After expanding the macro, the whole sequence (e.g. `abc`)
  will be the macro.

USAGE                                                             *dmacro-usage*

Before loading buffers, call the `setup()` function.
>
  require('dmacro').setup({
      dmacro_key = '<C-t>' --  you need to set the dmacro_key
  })
